The hub will operate as a network of scholars grounded in diverse feminist methods that will actively support the recovery of women writers and foster collaboration, mentorship, and community-building among women working in the digital humanities. The digital recovery hub will provide an infrastructure to offer scholars hands-on support in project management, quality control, and long-term sustainability, with broader goals to: 

1. reinvigorate the value of digital scholarship as a recovery method by supporting traditional editing projects while also exploring methods like network mapping, spatial analysis, multimedia storytelling, and the distant reading of massive datasets
2. make digital humanities tools and methodologies more accessible to institutions and individual scholars lacking adequate resources and experience 
3. act as a peer reviewing body
4. build a community of use to help recovery projects reach broader audiences
