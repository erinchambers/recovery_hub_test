The hub will operate as a network of scholars grounded in diverse feminist methods that will actively support the recovery of women writers and foster collaboration, mentorship, and community-building among women working in the digital humanities. The digital recovery hub will provide an infrastructure to offer scholars hands-on support in project management, quality control, and long-term sustainability, with broader goals to: 

* reinvigorate the value of digital scholarship as a recovery method by supporting traditional editing projects while also exploring methods like network mapping, spatial analysis, multimedia storytelling, and the distant reading of massive datasets
* make digital humanities tools and methodologies more accessible to institutions and individual scholars lacking adequate resources and experience 
* act as a peer reviewing body
* build a community of use to help recovery projects reach broader audiences
